title: SDE-II Backend Engineering Preparation Guide
sidebar_position: 1
---

This repository contains a **complete, day-wise preparation plan** to become a highly competent **SDE-II Backend Engineer**. While the guide is **language-agnostic**, we provide reference implementations in **Node.js (TypeScript)** and **Go (Golang)**.  
You will find:

- **Role understanding** and expectations in interviews and real teams
- **Skill gap analysis template** to self-assess
- A **16-week, day-wise roadmap** (with 8- and 12-week compression options)
- Deep dives into **TypeScript, Node.js, Databases, Redis, Queues, System Design, Machine Coding, DSA, Theory, Infra/AWS, CI/CD, and debugging**
- **Production-grade project ideas** and **interview prep playbook**
- **Daily / weekly schedules**, milestones, and metrics
- Curated **resources** (videos, blogs, repos, books)

### File Map (Start Here)

- **Meta & Self-Assessment**
  - [`getting-started/role-understanding.md`](getting-started/role-understanding.md) – What an SDE-II backend engineer is expected to do.
  - [`getting-started/skill-gap-template.md`](getting-started/skill-gap-template.md) – Self-assessment template across all key skills.
- **Roadmap & Schedules**
  - [`roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md`](roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md) – Phase-wise roadmap (JS/TS, Node, DBs, Redis/Queues, System Design, Machine Coding, DSA, Theory).
  - [`roadmap/schedules-and-metrics.md`](roadmap/schedules-and-metrics.md) – Daily/weekly schedules, milestones, metrics.
- **Weekly Plans**
  - Week 01 through Week 16 – **Day-wise plan for each week** (4h & 6h variants). Each week has both [Node.js](weeks/week-01/node) and [Go](weeks/week-01/go) tracks.
- **Topic Banks & Deep Dives**
  - [`topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md`](topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md) – At least 15 machine coding problems with specs.
  - [`topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md`](topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md) – Backend-focused DSA topics and problem plan.
  - [`topic-banks/theory-round.md`](topic-banks/theory-round.md) – OS, networking, DBMS, CAP/ACID/BASE, consistency models.
  - [`topic-banks/projects.md`](topic-banks/projects.md) – 5–8 production-ready backend project specs.
- **Interview Prep & Resources**
  - [`interview/interview-prep-playbook.md`](interview/interview-prep-playbook.md) – Mock interview structure, revision plans, common mistakes.
  - [`resources/resources.md`](resources/resources.md) – Curated resources for each topic.

For **quick navigation**:

- **Foundations (Weeks 1–3)**: [Week 01](weeks/week-01/node), [Week 02](weeks/week-02/node), [Week 03](weeks/week-03/node) (JS/TS deep dive).
- **Node.js Backend (Weeks 4–5)**: [Week 04](weeks/week-04/node), [Week 05](weeks/week-05/node).
- **Databases & Redis/Queues (Weeks 6–8)**: [Week 06](weeks/week-06/node), [Week 07](weeks/week-07/node), [Week 08](weeks/week-08/node).
- **System Design (Weeks 9–11)**: [Week 09](weeks/week-09/node), [Week 10](weeks/week-10/node), [Week 11](weeks/week-11/node).
- **Machine Coding (Weeks 12–13)**: [Week 12](weeks/week-12/node), [Week 13](weeks/week-13/node).
- **DSA Focus (Weeks 14–15)**: [Week 14](weeks/week-14/node), [Week 15](weeks/week-15/node).
- **Theory & Polishing (Week 16)**: [Week 16](weeks/week-16/node).

### How to Use This Guide

- **Step 1**: Read [`getting-started/role-understanding.md`](getting-started/role-understanding.md) and fill [`getting-started/skill-gap-template.md`](getting-started/skill-gap-template.md).
- **Step 2**: Skim [`roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md`](roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md) to understand the big picture.
- **Step 3**: Choose a track:
  - 16 weeks (recommended for deep mastery)
  - 12 weeks (compress by merging some weeks)
  - 8 weeks (aggressive, for experienced devs)
- **Step 4**: Follow the corresponding weekly plan files **day by day**, using:
  - [`topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md`](topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md), [`topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md`](topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md), [`topic-banks/theory-round.md`](topic-banks/theory-round.md), and [`topic-banks/projects.md`](topic-banks/projects.md) for exercises
  - [`resources/resources.md`](resources/resources.md) for videos/blogs/repos
- **Step 5**: In the last month, focus heavily on:
  - [`interview/interview-prep-playbook.md`](interview/interview-prep-playbook.md)
  - Re-doing key problems from [`topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md`](topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md) and [`topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md`](topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md)

Each markdown file contains **checklists, examples, ASCII diagrams, tables, and actionable tasks** so you can track your progress like a real project.
