### Weekly Goals

- **DSA**
  - Practice:
    - Trees (traversals, height, properties).
    - Graphs (BFS/DFS, shortest path, topological sort).
    - Heaps/priority queues (top-K, scheduling).
  - Perform **timed mixed sets**.
- **Interview Skills**
  - Emphasize clean communication and trade-offs.

Use together with:
- [DSA Backend Plan](../topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md)
- [Interview Prep Playbook](../interview/interview-prep-playbook.md)
