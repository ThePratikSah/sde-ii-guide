### Weekly Goals

- **DSA**
  - Practice:
    - Trees (traversals, height, basic properties).
    - Graphs (BFS/DFS, shortest path, topological sort basics).
    - Heaps/priority queues (top-K, scheduling).
  - Perform several **timed mixed sets**.
- **Interview Skills**
  - Emphasize clean communication and explaining trade-offs.

Use with:
- [DSA Backend Plan](../../topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md)
- [Interview Prep Playbook](../../interview/interview-prep-playbook.md)
