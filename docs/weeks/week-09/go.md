### Weekly Goals

- **System Design**
  - Learn structured approach to **system design interviews**.
  - Design **scalable REST APIs** for realistic services.
  - Understand **service boundaries**, API gateways, load balancing.
- **Backend Practice**
  - Map system designs to Go projects.
- **DSA**
  - Maintain 2–3 problems/day.
- **Theory**
  - Tie HTTP, networking, DB concepts into system design.

Use together with:
- [16-Week Roadmap](../roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md)
- [Projects](../topic-banks/projects.md)
- [Theory Round](../topic-banks/theory-round.md)
