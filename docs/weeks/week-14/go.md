### Weekly Goals

- **DSA**
  - Intensively practice:
    - Arrays & strings.
    - Maps & sets.
    - Two pointers & sliding window.
  - Build **pattern-based cheat sheet**.
- **Backend/Design**
  - Lightly maintain system design/machine coding familiarity.
- **Interview Skills**
  - Practice timed problem solving and communication.

Use together with:
- [DSA Backend Plan](../../topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md)
- [Interview Prep Playbook](../../interview/interview-prep-playbook.md)
