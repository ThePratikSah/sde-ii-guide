### Weekly Goals

- **System Design**
  - Design **Uber/Swiggy-like** system.
  - Design **notification system** with multiple channels.
- **Backend Practice**
  - Tie designs to Go projects.
- **DSA**
  - Continue mixed problems (graphs).
- **Theory**
  - Apply CAP, consistency, eventual consistency.

Use together with:
- [16-Week Roadmap](../roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md)
- [Projects](../topic-banks/projects.md)
- [Theory Round](../topic-banks/theory-round.md)
