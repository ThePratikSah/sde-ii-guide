## SDE-II Backend Engineering Preparation Guide

This repository contains a **complete, day-wise preparation plan** to become a highly competent **SDE-II Backend Engineer (Node.js / TypeScript)**.  
You will find:

- **Role understanding** and expectations in interviews and real teams
- **Skill gap analysis template** to self-assess
- A **16-week, day-wise roadmap** (with 8- and 12-week compression options)
- Deep dives into **TypeScript, Node.js, Databases, Redis, Queues, System Design, Machine Coding, DSA, Theory, Infra/AWS, CI/CD, and debugging**
- **Production-grade project ideas** and **interview prep playbook**
- **Daily / weekly schedules**, milestones, and metrics
- Curated **resources** (videos, blogs, repos, books)

### How to Use This Guide

- **Step 1**: Read [`meta/role-understanding.md`](meta/role-understanding.md) and fill [`meta/skill-gap-template.md`](meta/skill-gap-template.md).
- **Step 2**: Skim [`roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md`](roadmap/roadmap-16-weeks.md) to understand the big picture.
- **Step 3**: Choose a track:
  - 16 weeks (recommended for deep mastery)
  - 12 weeks (compress by merging some weeks)
  - 8 weeks (aggressive, for experienced devs)
- **Step 4**: Follow the corresponding `weeks/week-XX.md` file **day by day**, using:
  - [`topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md`](topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md), [`topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md`](topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md), [`topic-banks/theory-round.md`](topic-banks/theory-round.md), and [`topic-banks/projects.md`](topic-banks/projects.md) for exercises
  - [`resources/resources.md`](resources/resources.md) for videos/blogs/repos
- **Step 5**: In the last month, focus heavily on:
  - [`interview/interview-prep-playbook.md`](interview/interview-prep-playbook.md)
  - Re-doing key problems from [`topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md`](topic-banks/machine-coding-bank.md) and [`topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md`](topic-banks/dsa-backend-plan.md)

Each markdown file contains **checklists, examples, ASCII diagrams, tables, and actionable tasks** so you can track your progress like a real project.
