## Week 14 – DSA Focus I: Arrays, Strings, Hash Maps, Sliding Window

[← Back to main guide](../README.md)

<!-- Week 14 shifts focus to DSA for backend interviews, consolidating core patterns. -->

### Weekly Goals

- **DSA**
  - Intensively practice:
    - Arrays & strings.
    - Hash maps & sets.
    - Two pointers & sliding window.
  - Build a **pattern-based cheat sheet**.
- **Backend/Design**
  - Lightly maintain system design/machine coding familiarity (small daily touch).
- **Interview Skills**
  - Practice timed problem solving and communication.

Use with:
- `dsa-backend-plan.md`
- `interview-prep-playbook.md`

### Day 1 – Arrays & Strings: Basics & Frequency Counting

#### 4-Hour Plan

- **Block 1 (Warm-up – 30 min)**
  - 2 easy problems to get comfortable (e.g., reverse array, check palindrome).

- **Block 2 (Core Practice – 90 min)**
  - 3 medium problems focusing on:
    - Frequency counting.
    - Checking anagrams.
    - Character/word counts.

- **Block 3 (Review – 45–60 min)**
  - For each problem:
    - Document pattern and key insight.

- **Block 4 (Light Backend – 30–45 min)**
  - Skim notes from system design or machine coding (10–15 min).

#### 6-Hour Plan

- Add:
  - **Extra problems (60 min)**:
    - 1–2 more mediums or a hard if you are comfortable.

---

### Day 2 – Arrays & Strings: Two Pointers

#### 4-Hour Plan

- **Block 1 (Concepts – 30–45 min)**
  - Review two-pointer technique:
    - Left/right pointers on sorted arrays.
    - Partitioning and removing elements in-place.

- **Block 2 (Practice – 90 min)**
  - 3 medium two-pointer problems.

- **Block 3 (Review – 45–60 min)**
  - Capture the invariant for each problem:
    - What condition are pointers maintaining?

- **Block 4 (Light Backend – 30 min)**
  - Skim a system design note or revisit one machine coding design.

#### 6-Hour Plan

- Add:
  - **Timed problem (30 min)**:
    - Solve one medium problem under 30 minutes and analyze mistakes.

---

### Day 3 – Sliding Window: Fixed & Variable Size

#### 4-Hour Plan

- **Block 1 (Concepts – 30–45 min)**
  - Fixed-size vs variable-size windows.
  - Maintaining sum or counts within the window.

- **Block 2 (Practice – 90 min)**
  - 3 sliding window problems:
    - 1 fixed-size (e.g., max sum subarray of size k).
    - 2 variable-size (e.g., longest substring with K distinct chars).

- **Block 3 (Review – 45–60 min)**
  - Document sliding window template and when it applies.

- **Block 4 (Light Backend – 30 min)**
  - 10–15 min reading of rate limiter/caching notes.

#### 6-Hour Plan

- Add:
  - **Additional sliding window problems (60 min)**.

---

### Day 4 – Hash Maps & Sets: Lookup & Grouping

#### 4-Hour Plan

- **Block 1 (Warm-up – 30 min)**
  - 1 easy map/set problem (e.g., check duplicates).

- **Block 2 (Practice – 90 min)**
  - 3 medium problems focusing on:
    - Grouping elements (e.g., group anagrams).
    - Counting frequencies.
    - Map-based DP-like patterns (simple).

- **Block 3 (Review – 45–60 min)**
  - For each problem, log:
    - How the map/set reduced complexity.

- **Block 4 (Light Backend – 30 min)**
  - Quick review of DB indexing or caching.

#### 6-Hour Plan

- Add:
  - **Extra map/set problem (30–45 min)**:
    - Slightly more challenging one.

---

### Day 5 – Mixed Pattern Practice

#### 4-Hour Plan

- **Block 1 (Mixed Set – 90 min)**
  - 3–4 problems:
    - 1 array/string two-pointer.
    - 1 sliding window.
    - 1 hash map/set.

- **Block 2 (Timed Problem – 30–45 min)**
  - 1 problem under 30 minutes; treat as interview-style.

- **Block 3 (Review – 45–60 min)**
  - Note which pattern you recognized quickly vs slowly.

- **Block 4 (Light Backend – 30 min)**
  - 10–15 min: skim `interview-prep-playbook.md` coding tips.

#### 6-Hour Plan

- Add:
  - **One more timed problem (30 min)** and brief self-review.

---

### Day 6 – Timed Mixed Set (3–4 Problems)

#### 4-Hour Plan

- **Block 1 (Timed Set – 120 min)**
  - Solve a set of 3 medium problems:
    - 1 array/string.
    - 1 sliding window.
    - 1 hash map/two-pointer.
  - Time yourself ~35–40 min per problem.

- **Block 2 (Review – 60 min)**
  - For each problem:
    - Check for bugs, complexity, and clarity.

- **Block 3 (Light Backend – 30–45 min)**
  - Rehearse explaining one problem’s solution out loud.

#### 6-Hour Plan

- Add:
  - **Fourth problem (30–45 min)** if energy allows.

---

### Day 7 – Weekly Review & Pattern Cheat Sheet

#### 4-Hour Plan

- **Block 1 (Review – 60–75 min)**
  - Count how many problems solved this week by category.
  - Update `dsa-backend-plan.md` personal notes.

- **Block 2 (Pattern Cheat Sheet – 60–75 min)**
  - Create:
    - Sections for arrays/strings, two pointers, sliding window, hash maps.
    - Include template snippets and bullet points per pattern.

- **Block 3 (Planning – 30–45 min)**
  - Skim `week-15.md` (Trees/Graphs/Heaps focus).

#### 6-Hour Plan

- Add:
  - **Short mock (45–60 min)**:
    - 2 problems back-to-back, focusing on using the cheat sheet patterns quickly.
